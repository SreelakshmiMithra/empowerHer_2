# React Status Toggle 🔄

This project demonstrates **conditional rendering in React** using the `useState` hook. A button toggles a boolean status, and based on that status, different components are rendered.

This project is created using **React + Vite** and is suitable for beginners learning React fundamentals.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

* Manage component state using `useState`
* Toggle a boolean value on button click
* Render different components using conditional rendering (`? :`)

---

## 🧩 Features

* Single button to toggle status
* Displays different components based on state
* Clean and beginner-friendly code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React**
* **Vite**
* **JavaScript (JSX)**

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
src/
 └── App.jsx
```

(All components are written in a single file for simplicity.)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

* A state variable `status` is initialized as `false`
* Clicking the **Toggle Status** button switches the value between `true` and `false`
* Conditional rendering is used to show:

  * **ComponentA** when status is `true`
  * **ComponentB** when status is `false`

---

## ▶️ Sample Output

* Initial State: **Status is FALSE**
* After Click: **Status is TRUE**
* Click Again: **Status is FALSE**
