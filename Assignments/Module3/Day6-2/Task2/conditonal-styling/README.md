# Conditional Styling in React (React + Vite)

This project demonstrates **conditional styling in React** using the `useState` hook. A div changes its background color between **red** and **blue** when a button is clicked.

---

## 📌 Assignment Objective

* Create a div with some text inside
* Add a button to toggle the div color
* Initial color should be **red**
* On button click, color should change to **blue**
* On next click, color should switch back to **red**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* React (Functional Components)
* Vite
* JavaScript (ES6)
* useState Hook

---

## ⚙️ How the App Works
