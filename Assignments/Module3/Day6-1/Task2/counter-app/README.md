# Counter Application – React + Vite

This is a simple **Counter Application** built using **React** and **Vite** to demonstrate the use of:

- `useState` for state management
- `useEffect` with dependency array
- Conditional logic with alerts

---

## 🚀 Features

- Displays a counter value starting from `0`
- Increment button increases the count by `1`
- Whenever the count changes and is **divisible by 3**, an alert is shown:
  
  **"The current number (count) is divisible by 3"**

- The effect runs **only when the count changes**

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- React Functional Components
- `useState` Hook
- `useEffect` Hook with dependency array
- Event handling in React
- Basic CSS styling
